Random Code Challenges

This project is meant to create programming problems
for beginning Computer Science and Software Engineering
students.  The main problem I've been tackling is the
translation of English text to code and vis-versa.

Currently, it can make random:
simple and nested math problems
simple and nested boolean expressions
function calls
return statements
variable assignments
if statements
one line functions
